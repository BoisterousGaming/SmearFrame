## What is this?
This is an Unreal Engine 4 project containing a simple implementation of a "smear frame" effect, as recently popularized by the game Overwatch.

## How do I use this?
This effect consists of two parts: a blueprint component you add to an actor you want to be affected by the smear frame effect, and a material function that you add to its material.
